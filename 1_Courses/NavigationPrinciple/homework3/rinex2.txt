0. INTRODUCTION

0.1 First Revision

This paper is a revised version of the one published by W. Gurtner and G.
Mader in the CSTG GPS Bulletin of September/October 1990. The main reason
for a revision is the new treatment of antispoofing data by the RINEX
format (see chapter 7). Chapter 4 gives a recommendation for data
compression procedures, especially useful when large amounts of data are
exchanged through computer networks. In Table A3 in the original paper the
definiton of the "PGM / RUN BY / DATE" navigation header record was
missing, although the example showed it. The redefinition of AODE/AODC to
IODE/IODC also asks for an update of the format description. For consistency
reasons we also defined a Version 2 format for the Meteorological Data files
(inclusion of a END OF HEADER record and an optional MARKER NUMBER record).

*  The slight modification (or rather the definition of a bit in the Loss  *
*  of Lock Indicator unused so far) to flag AS data is so small a change   *
*  that we decided to NOT increase the version number!                     *

0.2 Later Revisions:

* URA Clarification (10-Dec-93):

  The user range accuracy in the Navigation Message File did not contain
  a definition of the units: There existed two ways of interpretation:
  Either the 4 bit value from the original message or the converted value
  in meters according to GPS ICD-200. In order to simplify the interpretation
  for the user of the RINEX files I propose the bits to be converted into meters
  prior to RINEX file creation.

* GLONASS Extensions:

  In March 1997 a proposal for extensions to the current RINEX definitions based
  on experiences collected with GLONASS only and mixed GPS/GLONASS data files
  was circulated among several instrument manufacturers and software developers.
  The results of the call for comments have been worked into this document.
  A separate document (glonass.txt) summarizes just the necessary extensions.

* A blank satellite identifier is allowed in pure GPS files only

* Met sensor description and position records were added to facilitate the
  precise use of met values.

* Description and examples for wavelength factors and their temporary changes
  (bit 1 of LLI) clarified.

* The RINEX documentation distributed in spring 1997 contained definitions for
  the GLONASS satellite clock offset and drift with the intention to have them
  defined identically to the GPS values. Unfortunately the GLONASS Interface
  Document consulted had a sign error in one of the formulae.

  The values should be stored into the RINEX file as -TauN, +GammaN, -TauC.
  The original definition asked for -TauN, -GammaN, +TauC. See paragraph 8.2.

  To avoid problems with files created with the original definitions a real
  valued version number (2.01) has been introduced for GLONASS nav mess files.

* IGS decided to use the Hatanaka compression scheme for RINEX observation
  files. Below the corresponding RINEX file name conventions are included
  as recommendations. The DOS naming (extension .yyE) was wrongly set to
  .yyY in the March 1998 version of the document.

* GPS week: The GPS week number in all RINEX files is a continuous number
  not affected by the 1024 roll-over, it runs from 1023 over 1024 to 1025 etc.

* A descrepancy between the definition of the header line fields of met sensor
  description and position in Table A5 and the example in Table A9 was removed.
  The latter was correct.


1. THE PHILOSOPHY OF RINEX

The first proposal for the "Receiver Independent Exchange Format" RINEX has
been developed by the Astronomical Institute of the University of Berne for
the easy exchange of the GPS data to be collected during the large European
GPS campaign EUREF 89, which involved more than 60 GPS receivers of 4
different manufacturers. The governing aspect during the development was
the following fact:

Most geodetic processing software for GPS data use a well-defined set of
observables:

- the carrier-phase measurement at one or both carriers (actually being a
measurement on the beat frequency between the received carrier of the
satellite signal and a receiver-generated reference frequency).

- the pseudorange (code) measurement, equivalent to the difference of the
time of reception (expressed in the time frame of the receiver) and the
time of transmission (expressed in the time frame of the satellite) of a
distinct satellite signal.

- the observation time being the reading of the receiver clock at the
instant of validity of the carrier-phase and/or the code measurements.

Usually the software assumes that the observation time is valid for both
the phase AND the code measurements, AND for all satellites observed.

Consequently all these programs do not need most of the information that is
usually stored by the receivers:  They need phase, code, and time in the
above mentioned definitions, and some station-related information like
station name, antenna height, etc.


2. GENERAL FORMAT DESCRIPTION

Currently the format consists of four ASCII file types:

   1. Observation Data File
   2. Navigation Message File
   3. Meteorological Data File
   4. GLONASS Navigation Message File

Each file type consists of a header section and a data section. The header
section contains global information for the entire file and is placed at
the beginning of the file. The header section contains header labels in
columns 61-80 for each line contained in the header section. These labels
are mandatory and must appear exactly as given in these descriptions and
examples.

The format has been optimized for mimimum space requirements independent
from the number of different observation types of a specific receiver by
indicating in the header the types of observations to be stored. In
computer systems allowing variable record lengths the observation records
may then be kept as short as possible. The maximum record length is 80
bytes per record.

Each Observation file and each Meteorological Data file basically contain
the data from one site and one session. RINEX Version 2 also allows to
include observation data from more than one site subsequently occupied by
a roving receiver in rapid static or kinematic applications.

If data from more than one receiver has to be exchanged it would not be
economical to include the identical satellite messages collected by the
different receivers several times. Therefore the Navigation Message File
from one receiver may be exchanged or a composite Navigation Message File
created containing non-redundant information from several receivers in
order to make the most complete file.

The format of the data records of the RINEX Version 1 Navigation Message 
file is identical to the former NGS exchange format.

The actual format descriptions as well as examples are given in the Tables
at the end of the paper.


3. DEFINITION OF THE OBSERVABLES

GPS observables include three fundamental quantities that need to be
defined: Time, Phase, and Range.

TIME:

  The time of the measurement is the receiver time of the received signals.
  It is identical for the phase and range measurements and is identical for
  all satellites observed at that epoch. It is expressed in GPS time (not
  Universal Time).

PSEUDO-RANGE:

  The pseudo-range (PR) is the distance from the receiver antenna to the
  satellite antenna including receiver and satellite clock offsets (and
  other biases, such as atmospheric delays):

    PR  =  distance +
           c * (receiver clock offset - satellite clock offset +
                other biases)

  so that the pseudo-range reflects the actual behavior of the receiver
  and satellite clocks. The pseudo-range is stored in units of meters.

  See also clarifications for pseudoranges in mixed GPS/GLONASS files in
  chapter 8.1.

PHASE:

  The phase is the carrier-phase measured in whole cycles at both L1 and
  L2. The half-cycles measured by sqaring-type receivers must be converted
  to whole cycles and flagged by the wavelength factor in the header
  section.

  The phase changes in the same sense as the range (negative doppler). The
  phase observations between epochs must be connected by including the
  integer number of cycles. The phase observations will not contain any
  systematic drifts from intentional offsets of the reference oscillators.

The observables are not corrected for external effects like atmospheric
refraction, satellite clock offsets, etc.

If the receiver or the converter software adjusts the measurements using
the real-time-derived receiver clock offsets dT(r), the consistency of the
3 quantities phase / pseudo-range / epoch must be maintained, i.e. the
receiver clock correction should be applied to all 3 observables:

  Time(corr)  = Time(r)  -  dT(r)
  PR(corr)    =  PR(r)   -  dT(r)*c
  phase(corr) = phase(r) -  dT(r)*freq

DOPPLER:

The sign of the doppler shift as additional observable is defined as usual:
Positive for approaching satellites.


4. THE EXCHANGE OF RINEX FILES:

We recommend using the following naming convention for RINEX files:

        ssssdddf.yyt      ssss:    4-character station name designator
                           ddd:    day of the year of first record
                             f:    file sequence number within day
                                   0: file contains all the existing
                                      data of the current day
                            yy:    year
                             t:    file type:
                                   O: Observation file
                                   N: Navigation file
                                   M: Meteorological data file
                                   G: GLONASS Navigation file

To exchange RINEX files on magnetic tapes we recommend using the following
tape format:

   - Non-label; ASCII; fixed record length: 80 characters;
     block size: 8000

   - First file on tape contains list of files using above-mentioned
     naming conventions

When data transmission times or storage volumes are critical we recommend
compressing the files prior to storage or transmission using the UNIX
"compress" und "uncompress" programs. Compatible routines are available on
VAX/VMS and PC/DOS systems, as well.

Proposed naming conventions for the compressed files:

     System   Obs files       GPS Nav Files   GLONASS Nav Files  Met Files
                             
     UNIX     ssssdddf.yyO.Z  ssssdddf.yyN.Z  ssssdddf.yyG.Z     ssssdddf.yyM.Z
     VMS      ssssdddf.yyO_Z  ssssdddf.yyN_Z  ssssdddf.yyG_Z     ssssdddf.yyM_Z
     DOS      ssssdddf.yyY    ssssdddf.yyX    ssssdddf.yyV       ssssdddf.yyW  
                             
Proposed naming conventions for observation files compressed using the
Hatanaka file compression scheme:

     System   Obs files      
                                                               
     UNIX     ssssdddf.yyD.Z 
     VMS      ssssdddf.yyD_Z 
     DOS      ssssdddf.yyE

5. RINEX VERSION 2 FEATURES
                           
The following section contains features that have been introduced for RINEX
Version 2.

5.1 Satellite Numbers:

Version 2 has been prepared to contain GLONASS or other satellite systems'
observations. Therefore we have to be able to distinguish the satellites
of the different systems:  We precede the 2-digit satellite number with a
system identifier.

        snn                  s:    satellite system identifier
                                   G or blank : GPS
                                   R          : GLONASS
                                   T          : Transit
                            nn:    PRN (GPS), almanac number (GLONASS)
                                   or two-digit Transit satellite number

        Note: G is mandatory in mixed GPS/GLONASS files

                                   (blank default modified in April 1997)

5.2 Order of the Header Records:

As the record descriptors in columns 61-80 are mandatory, the programs
reading a RINEX Version 2 header are able to decode the header records with
formats according to the record descriptor, provided the records have been
first read into an internal buffer.

We therefore propose to allow free ordering of the header records, with the
following exceptions:

- The "RINEX VERSION / TYPE" record must be the first record in a file

- The default "WAVELENGTH FACT L1/2" record (if present) should precede all
  records defining wavelength factors for individual satellites

- The "# OF SATELLITES" record (if present) should be immediately followed
  by the corresponding number of "PRN / # OF OBS" records. (These records
  may be handy for documentary purposes. However, since they may only be
  created after having read the whole raw data file we define them to be
  optional.

5.3 Missing Items, Duration of the Validity of Values

Items that are not known at the file creation time can be set to zero or
blank or the respective record may be completely omitted. Consequently
items of missing header records will be set to zero or blank by the program
reading RINEX files. Each value remains valid until changed by an
additional header record.

5.4. Event Flag Records

The "number of satellites" also corresponds to the number of records of the
same epoch followed. Therefore it may be used to skip the appropriate
number of records if certain event flags are not to be evaluated in detail.

5.5 Receiver Clock Offset

A large number of users asked to optionally include a receiver-derived
clock offset into the RINEX format. In order to prevent confusion and
redundancy, the receiver clock offset (if present) should report the value
that has been used to correct the observables according to the formulae
under item 1. It would then be possible to reconstruct the original
observations if necessary. As the output format for the receiver-derived
clock offset is limited to nanoseconds the offset should be rounded to
the nearest nanosecond before it is used to correct the observables in
order to guarantee correct reconstruction.


6. ADDITIONAL HINTS AND TIPS

Programs developed to read RINEX Version 1 files have to verify the version
number. Version 2 files may look different (version number, END OF HEADER
record, receiver and antenna serial number alphanumeric) even if they do
not use any of the new features

We propose that routines to read RINEX Version 2 files automatically delete
leading blanks in any CHARACTER input field. Routines creating RINEX
Version 2 files should also left-justify all variables in the CHARACTER
fields.

DOS, and other, files may have variable record lengths, so we recommend to
first read each observation record into a 80-character blank string and
decode the data afterwards. In variable length records, empty data fields
at the end of a record may be missing, especially in the case of the
optional receiver clock offset.


7. RINEX UNDER ANTISPOOFING (AS)

Some receivers generate code delay differences between the first and second
frequency using cross-correlation techniques when AS is on and may recover
the phase observations on L2 in full cycles. Using the C/A code delay on
L1 and the observed difference it is possible to generate a code delay
observation for the second frequency.

Other receivers recover P code observations by breaking down the Y code
into P and W code.

Most of these observations may suffer from an increased noise level. In
order to enable the postprocessing programs to take special actions, such
AS-infected observations are flagged using bit number 2 of the Loss of Lock
Indicators (i.e. their current values are increased by 4).


8. GLONASS Extensions

8.1 RINEX Observation file

8.1.1 Time System Identifier

RINEX Version 2 needs one major supplement, the explicit definition of the time
system:

GLONASS is basically running on UTC (or, more precisely, GLONASS system time
linked to UTC(SU)), i.e. the time tags are given in UTC and not GPS time.
In order to remove possible misunderstandings and ambiguities, the header
records "TIME OF FIRST OBS" and (if present) "TIME OF LAST OBS" in GLONASS and
GPS observation files _can_, in mixed GLONASS/GPS observation files _must_
contain a time system identifier defining the system that all time tags in the
file are referring to: "GPS" to identify GPS time, "GLO" to identify the
GLONASS UTC time system. Pure GPS files default to GPS and pure GLONASS files
default to GLO.

Format definitions see Table A1.

Hence, the two possible time tags differ by the current number of leap seconds.

In order to have the current number of leap seconds available we recommend
to include a LEAP SECOND line into the RINEX header.

If there are known non-integer biases between the "GPS receiver clock"
and "GLONASS receiver clock" in the same receiver, they should be applied.
In this case the respective code and phase observations have to be corrected,
too (c * bias if expressed in meters).

Unknown such biases will have to be solved for during the post processing
 
The small differences (modulo 1 second) between GLONASS system time, UTC(SU),
UTC(USNO) and GPS system time have to be dealt with during the post-processing
and not before the RINEX conversion. It may also be necessary to solve for
remaining differences during the post-processing.

8.1.2 Pseudorange Definition

The pseudorange (code) measurement is defined to be equivalent to the
difference of the time of reception (expressed in the time frame of the
receiver) and the time of transmission (expressed in the time frame of the
satellite) of a distinct satellite signal.

If a mixed-mode GPS/GLONASS receiver refers all pseudorange observations to
one receiver clock only,

- the raw GLONASS pseudoranges will show the current number of leap seconds
  between GPS time and GLONASS time if the receiver clock is running in the
  GPS time frame

- the raw GPS pseudoranges will show the negative number of leap seconds
  between GPS time and GLONASS time if the receiver clock is running in the
  GLONASS time frame

In order to avoid misunderstandings and to keep the code observations within
the format fields, the pseudoranges must be corrected in this case as follows:

  PR(GPS) := PR(GPS) + c * leap_seconds   if generated with a receiver clock
                                          running in the GLONASS time frame

  PR(GLO) := PR(GLO) - c * leap_seconds   if generated with a receiver clock
                                          running in the GPS time frame

to remove the contributions of the leap seconds from the pseudoranges.

"leap_seconds" is the actual number of leap seconds between GPS and GLONASS
(UTC) time, as broadcast in the GPS almanac and distributed in Circular T
of BIPM.

8.1.3 More than 12 satellites per epoch

The format of the epoch / satellite line in the observation record part of
the RINEX Observation files has only been defined for up to 12 satellites
per epoch. We explicitly define now the format of the continuation lines,
see table A2.


8.2 RINEX Navigation Files for GLONASS

As the GLONASS navigation message differs in contents from the GPS message
too much, a special GLONASS navigation message file format has been defined.

The header section and the first data record (epoch, satellite clock
information) is similar to the GPS navigation file. The following records
contain the satellite position, velocity and acceleration, the clock and
frequency biases as well as auxiliary information as health, satellite
frequency (channel), age of the information.

The corrections of the satellite time to UTC are as follows:

  GPS    : Tutc = Tsv - af0  -  af1  *(Tsv-Toc) - ... -  A0  - ... - leap_sec
  GLONASS: Tutc = Tsv + TauN - GammaN*(Tsv-Tb)        + TauC

***  In order to use the same sign conventions for the GLONASS corrections
     as in the GPS navigation files,  the broadcast GLONASS values are
     stored as:
                  -TauN, +GammaN, -TauC.

The time tags in the GLONASS navigation files are given in UTC (i.e. _not_
Moscow time or GPS time).

Filenaming convention: See above.
