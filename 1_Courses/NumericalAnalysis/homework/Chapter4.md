## Exercise 4.1

Show that there exists a unique solution to the initial-value problem
$$
y'=1+t\sin (ty), \quad 0\leq t\leq2, \quad y(0)=0
$$

## Exercise 4.2

Solve the following initial-value problem by using Euler's method,
$$
y'(t)=y(t)-t^2+1,t\in[0,2],y(0)=0.5
$$
Let $h=0.2$ and find a bound for the approximation error.

## Exercise 4.3

Apply Taylor's method of orders (1) two and (2) four with $n=10$ to the initial value problem
$$
y'=y-t^2+1, t\in[0,2],y(0)=0.5
$$
 

## Exercise 4.4

Use the Midpoint method and the Modified Euler method with $n=10, h=0.2, t_i=0.2i$ and $y_0=0.5$ to approximate the solution to 
$$
y'=y-t^2+1, t\in[0,2],y(0)=0.5
$$


## Exercise 4.5

Use the Runge-Kutta method of order 4 with $h=0.2, 0.1, 0.005$ to approximate the solution to
$$
y'=ty+t^3, t\in[0,2],y(0)=1
$$
and the exact solution is
$$
y=[-2e^{-t^2/2}(\frac{t^2}{2}+1)+3]e^{t^2/2}
$$
