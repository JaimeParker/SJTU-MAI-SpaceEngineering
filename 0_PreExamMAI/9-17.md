spacecrafts can be divided into two groups, manned spacecraft and unmanned spacecraft; 

| Spacecraft             | Functions                                                    |

| Flyby Spacecraft       | conducted the initial reconnaissance phase of solar system exploration |
| Orbiter Spacecraft     | travel to a distant planet and enter into orbit about it     |
| Atmospheric Spacecraft | a relatively short mission to collect data about the atmosphere of a planet or satellite |
| Lander Spacecraft      | reach the surface of a planet and survive long enough to telemeter data back to Earth |
| Penetrator Spacecraft  | entering the surface of a body, such as a comet, surviving an impact of hundreds of Gs, measuring, and telemetering the properties of the penetrated surface |

The addition of active magnetic control to a gravity gradient stabilized system appears as a means to  increase the system capabilities and performance while improving the overall cost trade-offs. An active  magnetic control system can provide very effective, rapid and tighter damping, and replace the passive  dampers. It does not require any moving parts; it can provide for automatic initial acquisition and  stabilization of the spacecraft in a spin control mode after launch; it can be used for attitude and angular rate  measurements and automatic gravity gradient capture; the magnetic torqueing capabilities can be used for  reversal for the spacecraft when necessary, and provide the capability for arbitrary control of the spacecraft  yaw angle.  

In addition such an active control system allows a relaxation of the requirements on the gravity gradient  boom; the boom does not need to be retractable and its thermal characteristics are less critical.  

The understanding of the advantages of such system led to detailed studies of adequate attitude determination  and control algorithms for its implementation. These algorithms were specifIed to provide for attitude  determination, automatic libration damping, and arbitrary yaw control with instrumentation limited to a  three-axis magnetometer, three magnetic torquers, and a control microprocessor.

This document discusses the results of the study of the application of an active magnetic control to gravity  gradient stabilized satellites conceived for a multiple satellite system. In the first part, the system and the  control method are described and analyzed. The results of realistic simulations are then presented and  discussed. Finally, the general description of a possible method for autonomous deployment sequence of  the spacecraft is presented. 

##### answer

==答案有不确定性，网上没有找到完全准确的回答==，磁控制方法似乎广泛出现在2010年前，按理说应用应该比较广，但在Google scholar和百度上资料不多，且国内相关论文影响因子很低；

An active  magnetic control system can provide very effective, rapid and tighter damping, and replace the passive  dampers.

Magnetic control can provide for automatic initial acquisition and  stabilization of the spacecraft in a spin control mode after launch.

Such actuators operate on the basis of the interaction between the geomagnetic field and a set of three orthogonal current-driven coils.

* [How Does NASA Make Modules Air Tight?](https://www.eclipseaviation.com/how-does-nasa-make-modules-air-tight/)

**Why are these docking seals important?**

**Pat:** *These seals prevent breathable air from escaping through the connection between the visiting spacecraft and the station. This connection is a heavily loaded somewhat dynamic structural interface and the seals must perform flawlessly during docking approach and while docked to the ISS. Because they’re orbiting 250-plus miles up, and the visiting spacecraft can stay docked months at a time, it’s critical that the seals have very low leakage to minimize the amount of make-up supply air needed to maintain cabin pressure on the laboratory.*

*The seal we developed is a little over four feet in diameter, which is large enough to allow the crew and some cargo to transfer from the visiting spacecraft to the station. The seal has two redundant sealing surfaces or interfaces and had to be narrow enough to fit in the limited space available on the docking interface. It also had to be strong and resilient to withstand the extreme environment of space. Through development testing on the ground, we were able to prove that our design leaked less air per day than what would fill a standard pop can (about 12 oz or 330 ml). That is a really low leak rate for a seal of that size that also has to survive the challenging environment of space.*

**What were some of the seal design challenges that had to be addressed?**

**Pat:** *We had to evaluate the seal at every possible condition – both environmental and mechanical – that it would experience during flight. We also had to look at reusability.*

*We chose to make the seal out of silicone, a rubber-like material that can withstand the extreme temperatures experienced in space. It also had to survive exposure to damaging ultraviolet rays that are more severe on orbit than on the ground, without the leak rate increasing significantly. The seal material also couldn’t be overly sticky so it wouldn’t adhere to the metal sealing surface on the station side of the connection.*

*We tested multiple, smaller versions of different designs first to make sure they met all the requirements before testing full-scale versions of the final seal design for the docking system. Prior to the flight with Space X, we also tested small prototype seals in space, including some that were on the station for more than 18 months. Those prototypes were exposed to the harsh environment of space and were then brought back for additional testing.*

##### answer

* airtight is not perfect. By using constant monitoring, the cabin loses 1 mm of its air every day. so the live-able atmosphere pressure is preserved, and leaks are identified;
* seals(usually rubber) prevent breathable air from escaping through the connection between spacecraft's cabins;
* Based on remarks, a 3 mm drill and two sealing pastes and sealant materials were used to put the seal on the holes

航天器结构是[航天器](https://baike.baidu.com/item/航天器/3514266)各个受力和支承构件的总成，一般分为卫星结构、[空间探测器](https://baike.baidu.com/item/空间探测器/2197594)结构、[载人飞船](https://baike.baidu.com/item/载人飞船/377970)结构和[航天飞机](https://baike.baidu.com/item/航天飞机/315272)结构。它的作用是安装、连接各种仪器设备和动力装置，满足它们所需要的环境要求，承受地面操作、发射、轨道飞行和返回地面时的外力，并保持航天器的完整性。对航天器结构的基本要求是重量小、可靠性高、成本低等，通常用结构质量比，即结构重量占航天器总重的比例来衡量航天器结构设计和制造的水平，这个比值越小表示水平越高。航天器任务的多样性决定航天器结构形式的多样性。

##### answer

* The space vehicle structure must be designed to accommodate the maximum positive and negative pressure differentials across the pressure shell;
* The design implementation approach is crucial to ensuring a solution that addresses the technical issues yet minimizes the operational impacts;
* Each program must individually weigh the hardware weight impact against the downstream recurring operational costs for the vehicle;
* The basic requirements for the structure of the spacecraft are less weight, high reliability, low cost, etc., and usually use the structure quality ratio, which is, the proportion of structural weights to measure the level of spacecraft structure design and manufacturing.

##### answer

On space vehicles, control systems are an integral part of virtually all payloads and subsystems;

Virtually all spacecraft payloads and subsystems rely on closed-loop systems to control：

* Momentum (angular and linear)—the job of attitude and orbit control subsystem (AOCS) 
* Imaging, communicating, and operating other missions—payloads
* Data (bits and bytes)—the job of communication and data-handling subsystem (CDHS) 
* Power (current, voltage, distribution)—controlled by the electrical power subsystem (EPS) 
* Internal environment (temperature, air, water, food, waste)—the job of environmental control and life-support subsystem (ECLSS) 
* Loads (bending, twisting, shaking)—handled by structures and mechanisms 
* Rocket thrust (valves, pressure, temperature)—provided by the propulsion subsystem
